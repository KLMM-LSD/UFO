**Abstract 1, Monitoring**
```
- Being able of monitoring large systems is an important part when developing large systems undergoing constant development and changes
- Constant monitoring will avoid too much downtime on the system and can help with performance
- By using various tools and services we are able to use Prometheus/Grafana in our development process
- this practice of monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, once made and deployed can be used again with changes if needed.
```
**Abstract 3, Monitoring 2**
```
It can be a challenge as a developer, to keep track of your systems state and issues that might arise. 
Fixing said issues costs money and having to find the issues costs additionally, 
which is obviously something to limit in business. By utilizing Monitoring systems, 
you can minimize the time spend looking for problems and perhaps know about them before they even become an issue. 
That way you can immediately start fixing problems as they occur and save time in the process, which is beneficial
for developer/support as well as customer.
```
**Abstract 2, Scaling**
```
As a website's traffic increases, so does the load on server equipment. 
This can lead to long response times, instability and even complete service shutdowns, making it impossible to ensure a good experience for all of your users.
By separating the hosting of your business logic and Relational Database, you can optimize workloads with a combination of vertical and horizontal scaling.
This lets you deliver a stable, responsive experience to your users, at a lower cost than simply throwing money at your hosting provider.

## Abstract entries:
**Abstract 1, Monitoring**
- Being able of monitoring large systems is an important part when developing large systems undergoing constant development and changes
- Constant monitoring will avoid too much downtime on the system and can help with performance
- By using various tools and services we are able to use Prometheus/Grafana in our development process
- this practice of monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, once made and deployed can be used again with changes if needed.
**Abstract 2, Scaling**
```
As a website's traffic increases, so does the load on server equipment. 
This can lead to long response times, instability and even complete service shutdowns, making it impossible to ensure a good experience for all of your users.
By separating the hosting of your business logic and Relational Database, you can optimize workloads with a combination of vertical and horizontal scaling.
This lets you deliver a stable, responsive experience to your users, at a lower cost than simply throwing money at your hosting provider.
